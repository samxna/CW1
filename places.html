<p>Travelling the world has always been one of my ultimate passions. Fortunately, from a young age, I was able to start living this dream with my amazing family. Every now and then when me and my family are free together such as during the holidays, my father books something within the blink of an eye, from plane tickets to sight-seeing around the edge of the UK. </p>
<p>Due to the unfortunate distractions caused by the recent pandemic, we haven't been able to travel abroad in the recent years. Nevertheless, we took this opportunity to explore the hidden gems of the country we reside in, from city to city, island to island which I will be showcasing briefly below! </p>
<p>Click on a tab to view some beautiful memories that I had captured during my adventures! :)</p>
